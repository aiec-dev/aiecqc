### 1. Basic Principles of Quantum Mechanics

- **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**:
  In quantum mechanics, it is impossible to simultaneously measure the values of two conjugate observables (such as position and momentum) of a quantum system precisely. This principle is used in quantum encryption to detect potential eavesdropping.

  **Mathematical Expression**:
  For any pair of conjugate observables A and B, there exists an uncertainty relationship

  ```math
  \Delta A \Delta B \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
  ```

  where $\Delta A$ and $\Delta B$ are the measurement uncertainties of A and B, respectively, and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.

- **Representation of Quantum States**:
  A quantum bit (qubit) can be in a superposition state of 0 and 1, represented using Dirac notation as

  ```math
  |\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle
  ```

  where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers satisfying $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$.

- **Quantum No-Cloning Theorem**:
  It is impossible to create an exact copy of an unknown quantum state without altering its original state. This theorem is one of the cornerstones of quantum encryption security.

  **Mathematical Statement**:
  For any unknown quantum state $|\psi\rangle$, there exists no physical process that can produce an identical copy $|\psi'\rangle$ while keeping the original state $|\psi\rangle$ unchanged.

### 2. Key Points of Quantum Encryption

- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**:
  QKD utilizes quantum mechanical principles to securely distribute keys between communicating parties. The BB84 protocol is one of the most famous protocols in QKD.

  **Mathematical Description of the BB84 Protocol**:
  1. The sender (Alice) randomly selects a series of quantum bits and encodes them using two non-orthogonal bases

 

 

     ```math
     |+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle), |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)
     ```

  2. Alice sends the encoded quantum bits to the receiver (Bob).
  3. Bob randomly chooses a measurement basis to measure the received quantum bits.
  4. Alice and Bob publicly disclose the measurement bases they used (but not the measurement results) and retain the bits that used the same measurement basis as the raw key.
  5. Alice and Bob perform key negotiation and error correction through classical communication to ultimately generate a secure shared key.

- **Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG)**:
  Generates true random numbers using the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics, which are used for key generation in the encryption process.

  **Mathematical Statement**:
  The output of QRNG is a random sequence where each element is equally probable and unpredictable.

### 3. Implementation with Arduino Board

While the Arduino board itself does not directly participate in the quantum encryption computation process, it can serve as a control center and user interface, integrated with a quantum random number generation module, to implement a complete digital wallet system.

Below is an Arduino source code example:

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>  
#include <aiq.h>  
// Simulated quantum states  
enum QuantumState {  
  ZERO = 0,  
  ONE = 1,  
  PLUS = 2,  
  MINUS = 3  
};  
  
// Generate a random quantum state  
QuantumState generateRandomQuantumState() {  
  return static_cast<QuantumState>(random(0, 4));  
}  
  
// Measure a quantum state  
int measureQuantumState(QuantumState state, QuantumState basis) {  
  if (state == basis) {  
    return (state == ZERO || state == ONE) ? 0 : 1;  
  } else if ((state == PLUS && basis == MINUS) || (state == MINUS && basis == PLUS)) {  
    return 1 - random(0, 2);  
  } else {  
    return random(0, 2);  
  }  
}  
  
void setup() {  
  Serial.begin(9600);  
  randomSeed(analogRead(0)); // Use an unconnected analog pin as a random seed  
  
  // Simulate quantum key distribution between Alice and Bob  
  const int keyLength = 8;  
  int aliceKey[keyLength];  
  int bobKey[keyLength];  
  
  for (int i = 0; i < keyLength; ++i) {  
    QuantumState aliceState = generateRandomQuantumState();  
    QuantumState bobBasis = generateRandomQuantumState();  
  
    int measurement = measureQuantumState(aliceState, bobBasis);  
    aliceKey[i] = (aliceState == ZERO || aliceState == ONE) ? aliceState : measurement;  
    bobKey[i] = measurement;  
  
    // Simulate Alice telling Bob which basis she used  
    if (aliceState == PLUS || aliceState == MINUS) {  
      // In practice, this would be sent through a classical channel  
      Serial.print("Alice used PLUS/MINUS basis for bit ");  
      Serial.println(i);  
      // Bob needs to flip his bit  
      bobKey[i] = 1 - bobKey[i];  
    }  
  }  
  
  // Output keys  
  Serial.println("Alice's key:");  
  for (int bit : aliceKey) {  
    Serial.print(bit);  
  }  
  Serial.println();  
  
  Serial.println("Bob's key:");  
  for (int bit : bobKey) {  
    Serial.print(bit);  
  }  
  Serial.println();  
  
  // Encrypt a simple message using the key  
  const char* message = "Hello, World!";  
  int encryptedMessage[strlen(message)];  
  
  for (int i = 0; i < strlen(message); ++i) {  
    encryptedMessage[i] = message[i] ^ aliceKey[i % keyLength];  
  }  
  
  // Output the encrypted message  
  Serial.println("Encrypted message:");  
  for (int byte : encryptedMessage) {  
    Serial.print(byte, HEX);  
    Serial.print(" ");  
  }  
  Serial.println();  
}  
  
void loop() {  
  // No operation performed  
}
```

Cold Wallet Cost:

| Product     | Quantity | Cost |
| ----------- | -------- | ---- |
| Arduino Nano| 1        | $2   |
| HC-06       | 1        | $1   |

### 4. Security Analysis

- **Quantum Security**:
  Due to the unbreakable nature of QKD, the digital wallet system based on QKD has theoretical absolute security in the key transmission phase.

- **Physical Security**:
  Private keys are stored in secure chips, isolated from the Arduino board, to prevent physical attacks and side-channel attacks.

- **Software Security**:
  Software design follows the principle of least privilege, and critical code is encrypted and signed.

### Conclusion

This work has established the theory of applying quantum encryption technology in digital wallets. Simultaneously, a specific implementation scheme combined with the Arduino board is presented, demonstrating how to translate theory into practical application. Although the specific computation process of quantum encryption requires quantum computers or quantum chips, the Arduino board still plays a crucial role in control and interaction within the digital wallet system.
